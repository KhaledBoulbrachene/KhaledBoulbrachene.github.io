      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wind Analysis of the high-rise building 1180 Peachtree, Atlanta, Georgia, US. Historical wind velocities for the previous 30 years were collected and an analytical aerostatic and aerodynamic analysis using the Eurocode was performed on the building. Then, a CFD simulation was done using KRATOS open-source project developed by the chair and CIMNE, a reseach center in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Isogeometric analyis of trimmed membrane structures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The task was to extend a given code for the IGA of untrimmed membranes to the application of trimmed IGA. IGA uses the CAD information as an analysis model, instead of constructing a separate computational model. In order to get accurate results, a k-refinement is performed on the geometrical model. To represent complex geometries trimmed NURBS geometries are employed. In this present work, form finding is done on trimmed membrane surfaces. This project is implemented using MATLAB for the analysis and Rhino to define the geometries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analytical Structural Design and a Feasibility Study of a Commercial-Residential Building Following the Standards of Kuwait</title>
      <link>https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/project/bachelor/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An analytical structural design of an eco-friendly commercial-residential building in a vacant area in Jabriya, Kuwait. In addition, a feasibility study was established to determine the Pay Back Period of such a project. First, we start with an established soil report of the empty area to choose the structural system, and approximate loads of the building to determine the dimensions of each structural element following the ACI and ASCE standards. Then, a total cost estimation is done using a complete bill of quantity with a task timetable schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
