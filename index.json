Two spatial dimensions are considered and the discretizations are carried out for Cartesian uniform and non-uniform grids. Imple- mentations are then verified and the order of accuracy of the adopted spatial and temporal discretization schemes is validated. Next, an Immersed Boundary method (IBM) with a direct forcing strategy is integrated with both flow solvers to simulate fluid-solid interac- tion problems. The continuous IB method employs a smoothed approximation of the Dirac delta function with a specific order of accuracy to smear (regularize) the immersed boundary forces over the adjacent fluid cells. The accuracy of the solver then becomes dependent on the order at which the coupling quantities are interpolated. In the literature, there exist dif- ferent second-order regularized delta-function variants which are well-suited to use with the second-order finite volume solver. However, an appropriate fourth-order regularized delta function is not available and its detailed derivation is presented. At last, several numeri- cal tests with smooth and non-smooth velocity fields are conducted to observe the rate of convergence achieved of both IBM solvers.\n","date":1547078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547078400,"objectID":"ce748a0c5ddd0e0d69b63b001ddd1f8c","permalink":"https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/project/fv_ib/","publishdate":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fv_ib/","section":"project","summary":"Master Thesis","tags":["Computational Fluid Dynamics","Fluid Structure Interaction","Numerical analysis"],"title":"Implementation of an Immersed Boundary Method for a fourth-order Finite Volume Scheme, Master Thesis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"An alternate method to model transient PDEs, where time is considered as a dimension, in contrast to the conventional transient FEM, where the space is discretized and a time intrgration scheme is applied. Thus, the 1D problem becomes 2D, and the shape functions are a tensor product of space and time. This approach is advntegous for its exponential convergence in time (when using high order shape functions), the ability to perform local time refinement, etc.\n","date":1542240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1542240000,"objectID":"db7573482cf8be3f02169a59b7ac663a","permalink":"https://KhaledBoulbrachene.github.io/project/fcm/","publishdate":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fcm/","section":"project","summary":"A Project of the course Software Lab.","tags":["FEM","transient FEM"],"title":"Space-Time Finite Elements For 1D Heat Equation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The task was to extend a given code for the IGA of untrimmed membranes to the application of trimmed IGA.

To represent complex geometries trimmed NURBS geometries are employed. In this present work, form finding is done on trimmed membrane surfaces.
